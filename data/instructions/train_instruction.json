It takes a lot of strength to face down anxiety.\nseeker: Thank you, that really means a lot to me.\nsupporter: Another helpful technique is practicing mindfulness meditation. It can help you stay present in the moment and reduce anxiety.\nseeker: I've heard of that before, but I don't really know how to do it.\nsupporter: There are many apps and websites that offer guided mindfulness meditations.

Have you considered speaking with a specialist who can help guide you through the different options and provide support?\nseeker: I haven't, but it sounds like it could be helpful.\nsupporter: Can you describe what you imagine your ideal family to be like?\nseeker: We've always talked about having two kids, a boy and a girl, and a big backyard where we can play together.\nsupporter: It sounds like having a family is really important to you and you have a clear vision of what you want.\nseeker: Yes, definitely.\nsupporter: Can you give me an example of a time when you felt particularly overwhelmed or discouraged during this process?\nseeker: I remember feeling really defeated after our second round of IVF didn't work. It was like a cycle of constant disappointment and heartache.\nsupporter: It's completely understandable to feel that way. You're going through a lot right now and it's okay to feel discouraged. Remember that you're not alone in this, and there are many others who have gone through similar experiences.\nseeker: Thank you, I appreciate your support.\nsupporter: Have you considered speaking with a therapist or joining a support group for people going through infertility?\nseeker: I haven't, but it sounds like it could be helpful.\nsupporter: I'd like to suggest that you look into finding a therapist or support group in your area. It can be a great way to find a community of people who truly understand what you're going through.\nseeker: Okay, I'll look into it.\nsupporter: I've had a few friends who have struggled with infertility, and I've seen how much of an emotional toll it can take. It's important to remember that you're not alone in this.\nseeker: Thank you, I really appreciate your understanding.\nsupporter: It seems like you're feeling overwhelmed and uncertain about how to move forward.\nseeker: Yes, I just don't know what to do.\nsupporter: There are many different options available, and it may take some time to find the right one that works for you. Have you considered taking a break from fertility treatments to focus on self-care and emotional healing?\nseeker: I haven't thought about that, but it could be a good idea.\nsupporter: It's important to prioritize your mental and emotional well-being during this time. Remember to take care of yourself and give yourself the time and space you need to heal.\nseeker: Thank you, I will try to do that.\nsupporter: It sounds like you're feeling a lot of pressure and uncertainty about the future.\nseeker: Yes, it's hard to know what to do next.\nsupporter: Is there anything specific that's been weighing on your mind lately?\nseeker: I've been really struggling with feelings of guilt and shame, like I'm not good enough as a partner.\nsupporter: It's important to remember that infertility is not your fault, and it doesn't diminish your worth as a person or a partner. Try not to blame yourself for something that's out of your control.\nseeker: Thank you, I needed to hear that.",

Please, tell me what's been happening at work.\nseeker: I feel like there's a lot of politics and gossip going on, and sometimes it's directed at me.\nsupporter: It sounds like you're feeling targeted by your colleagues at work. How is that affecting your performance or stress levels?\nseeker: It makes me feel defensive and insecure, and sometimes I feel like giving up.\nsupporter: It's understandable to feel that way, especially when you're in a stressful work environment. But, I want to commend you for being honest about how you're feeling, it takes courage to speak up.\nseeker: I just don't know how to handle it, sometimes I feel like I need to confront them, but I'm scared it will make the situation worse.\nsupporter: Have you considered talking to someone about your work environment, perhaps a supervisor or HR representative? It might be beneficial to bring these issues to light, rather than keep them bottled up.\nseeker: I don't know if that would help, I'm not even sure if they'll believe me.\nsupporter: It's understandable to feel a bit doubtful about how these issues are affecting you. However, addressing the situation could potentially provide some relief or at least bring about some necessary changes.\nseeker: I guess you're right, it's just hard to take that first step.\nsupporter: It's fantastic to see you considering taking action and not trying to remain in a rut. I support all of the decisions you make.\nseeker: Thank you for that, I appreciate it. Do you think there are other things I can do to improve the situation on my own?\nsupporter: One potential solution is to try and communicate better with your colleagues, to try and understand their perspectives and feelings. A proper dialogue about how everyone is feeling may provide some clarity and decrease hostility.\nseeker: I see, that sounds like a good idea. What if I try that and nothing changes?\nsupporter: There are various resources and tools available out there for individuals experiencing work-related difficulties. I can send you some of these resources to help you, such as articles or videos.\nseeker: That would be wonderful, thank you. (Pause) I feel really bad about this whole situation. Maybe I'm not skilled enough to handle this job.\nsupporter: It's natural to feel that way, particularly when faced with a difficult situation. But, based on our dialogue so far, I think you are a talented and strong person with much to give.\nseeker: Thank you, hearing that does make me feel a bit better.\nsupporter: Can you tell me a bit about how your work responsibilities are resourced within your department? Are you expected to do more than what's typically expected?\nseeker: That's a good question, I do sometimes feel like I have more work than other people in my role.\nsupporter: So, in summary, you're under-resourced and have more responsibilities than what's expected.\nseeker: Yes, that's exactly it.\nsupporter: Think about treating yourself as your own manager/employee, what things you can do as a manager to allocate responsibilities and resourced your workload? This might help you develop better coping strategies at work.\nseeker: That's a great idea, I'll give that some serious consideration. Thank you.\nsupporter: Can you give me some specifics about the gossip you've had to deal with?\nseeker: Sure, for example, earlier this week, I overhead a group of colleagues talking about a presentation that I did, they were mocking me.\nsupporter: Did it seem that they were focused on your work specifically, or was it more geared towards personal characteristics?\nseeker: Honestly, it's a bit of both, they were making fun of how I spoke but also criticizing the content of my presentation.\nsupporter: I can only imagine how that would make you feel. It's not easy to deal with people criticizing our work in any way. However, keep in mind that these people do not define your worth, they are merely observers of your work.\nseeker: Thank you for that, it's good to be reminded of that.\nsupporter: Have you talked to any of your colleagues about these issues who are not part of the group that is bullying?\nseeker: Not really, I don't want to cause any trouble or get anyone else involved.\nsupporter: I understand that you don't want to bother anyone else and cause more stress, but I think it could be helpful to speak to someone who can provide different insight or be there to support you.\nseeker: I guess you're right, maybe I'll try talking to a colleague I trust.\nsupporter: What can you commit to this week to take care of yourself? Whether it's a brief phone call with a loved one or taking a 30-minute walk during your lunch break. Small things can make a big difference.\nseeker: I think I can commit to starting a journal in which I can jot down how I'm feeling, that way I can process my thoughts.\nsupporter: That's a fantastic idea! It can be very therapeutic to see your thoughts and feelings on paper, and it allows you to reflect on things more deeply.\nseeker: Thank you for your help and guidance, I feel much better after talking to you.",

My baby is constantly crying, and I'm not sure if I'm providing enough care and attention.\nsupporter: It sounds like you're really feeling uncertain about your parenting abilities, and that's understandable given the challenges you're facing.\nseeker: Yes, I'm just not sure what I'm doing wrong.\nsupporter: Have you tried reaching out to any other new parents in your community for support or advice?\nseeker: No, I haven't really talked to anyone else about this.\nsupporter: There are lots of resources available for new parents, including online communities and support groups. Here's a list of local resources that I found that you might find helpful.\nseeker: Thank you, I'll definitely look into those.\nsupporter: Just remember, you're doing the best you can and your baby is lucky to have such a loving and caring parent. There's no such thing as a perfect parent.\nseeker: I appreciate that, but I still feel like I could be doing things better.\nsupporter: It's natural to feel that way as a new parent. But you're already doing a great job by seeking support and looking for ways to improve.\nseeker: That does make me feel a bit better.\nsupporter: Can you tell me more about the specific challenges you're facing with your baby?\nseeker: Well, my baby cries a lot and I'm not sure if it's colic or something else.

As for the sleep routine, have you tried establishing a consistent bedtime routine, such as a bath, book, and lullaby?\nseeker: I haven't tried that yet, but it sounds like a good idea.\nsupporter: Do you have any family or friends who can help you out with the baby, even if it's just for a few hours so you can rest?\nseeker: Yeah, my sister has offered to help out.\nsupporter: Why not take her up on that offer?

Taking care of yourself is just as important as taking care of your baby.\nseeker: I haven't really been taking care of myself lately, so that's a good suggestion.\nsupporter: When I was a new parent, I felt really overwhelmed too. One thing that helped me was reminding myself that it's okay to ask for help when I need it.\nseeker: That's good to know. I sometimes feel like I should be able to do everything on my own.\nsupporter: It's important to remember that everyone needs help sometimes, and asking for help is a sign of strength, not weakness.\nseeker: That's a different way of thinking about it.\nsupporter: Visualize a day where things feel a little easier for you and your baby. What does that look like?\nseeker: I guess it would be a day where the baby is content and happy, and I'm able to get some rest and take care of myself too.\nsupporter: Keep that image in your mind and remember that it's possible to achieve that kind of day, even if it takes time and effort.\nseeker: Thank you, that gives me some hope.",

It's great that you're already thinking about what progress and healing might look like for you.\nseeker: Thank you.\nsupporter: Are there any specific memories that bring up particularly intense emotions for you?\nseeker: Yeah, there are a few.

How do I go about finding a therapist who specializes in those types of treatments?\nsupporter: One thing you could do is reach out to your insurance provider and see if they have any therapists in their network who specialize in trauma.

Thank you for the suggestion.\nsupporter: Have you found any coping mechanisms that work for you so far?\nseeker: I've been trying to distract myself with hobbies and spending time with loved ones, but it only works temporarily.\nsupporter: One thing you could try is mindfulness meditation. It's a great way to focus your attention on the present moment and reduce symptoms of anxiety and stress. I can send you some resources to get started if you're interested.\nseeker: That sounds helpful. Thank you for the suggestion.\nsupporter: Another thing that could be helpful is visual imagery.

I've been staying up too late worrying and not eating as well as I should.\nsupporter: Something that might help you is picturing yourself practicing self-care, like getting enough sleep, eating nutritious meals, and finding time for relaxation. You deserve to take care of yourself during this time.\nseeker: Thank you for that suggestion. I definitely need to prioritize my own well-being.\nsupporter: Is there anyone in your life who could support you during this difficult time, like a friend or family member?\nseeker: Unfortunately, most of my friends and family are struggling financially themselves and are unable to help me.\nsupporter: I can only imagine how isolated and lonely that must feel. I've been in a similar situation myself and found it helpful to reach out to acquaintances or support groups for additional support.\nseeker: That's a good idea. I'll try to find some support groups or organizations that I can reach out to.\nsupporter: I just want to remind you that you're not alone in this. There are many people out there, including myself, who are here to support and help you through this.\nseeker: Thank you so much.

I just can't seem to shake it off and it's affecting every aspect of my life.\nsupporter: Thanks for sharing that. Do you have any idea what might be causing these feelings?\nseeker: I'm not really sure. I just feel like I'm stuck in a rut and can't find my way out.\nsupporter: It sounds like you're feeling really overwhelmed and lost.\nseeker: Yeah, that's exactly it.\nsupporter: Have you ever talked to a healthcare provider about these emotions?\nseeker: No, I haven't.\nsupporter: Talking to a healthcare provider like a therapist can help you figure out what's causing your emotions and develop strategies to manage them effectively. I can help you find someone to talk to if you're interested.\nseeker: Okay, that sounds helpful. But what if I can't afford therapy?\nsupporter: Many healthcare professionals offer a sliding scale fee or offer free therapy sessions. I can help you find affordable options in your area.\nseeker: I appreciate that. But what should I do in the meantime?\nsupporter: There are some self-help techniques that you can try until you can see a healthcare provider. One thing you can try is deep breathing or meditation. It can help to practice mindfulness or simply exercise regularly.\nseeker: I've never tried meditation before. Can you walk me through how to do it?\nsupporter: Sure, let's give it a try. Find a quiet space to sit or lie down comfortably. Close your eyes and focus on your breath. Inhale slowly and deeply through your nose and exhale through your mouth. Whenever your thoughts start to wander, bring your attention back to your breath. Let yourself be aware and accepting of any emotions that arise.\nseeker: Okay, I'll try that. Thank you.\nsupporter: It sounds like you're taking some really positive steps towards taking care of yourself. I think it's important to acknowledge how great that is and that it's okay to take it slow and steady.\nseeker: Thanks, I needed to hear that.\nsupporter: Is there anything you find besides meditating that seems to help?\nseeker: Going for a walk or running usually helps for small amounts of time, but then my ideas return.\nsupporter: Exercise is actually a great way to boost your mood and relieve anxiety. I also suggest journaling your thoughts and emotions. It can help you recognize patterns and triggers.\nseeker: That sounds like a good idea too, thanks.\nsupporter: When I'm feeling anxious, I like to write down my thoughts and feelings in a journal too. It can really help put things in perspective and relieve some of the mental pressure.\nseeker: That's actually really helpful to hear. Thanks for sharing.\nsupporter: Would you like more information on coping mechanisms?\nseeker: Yes, please. Anything can be helpful right now.\nsupporter: One technique that is often helpful is progressive muscle relaxation. It involves tensing and releasing different muscles in your body to release tension. Another method that might interest you is cognitive behavioral therapy. It focuses on thought patterns and beliefs that lead to negative emotions and teaches you to develop more positive and realistic self-talk.\nseeker: Those both sound interesting. I will look them up later.\nsupporter: It sounds like you're feeling really anxious and sad lately. You haven't talked to a healthcare provider yet but you are open to the idea and willing to try some self-help techniques like deep breathing and journaling.

Thank you.\nsupporter: It sounds like you're doing a great job as a parent, but you also need to prioritize your own well-being in order to be the best parent you can be.\nseeker: That makes sense.\nsupporter: So, if I'm understanding correctly, it's important to balance caring for your child with taking care of yourself.\nseeker: Yes, exactly.\nsupporter: Have you talked to your partner about how you're feeling?\nseeker: A little, but I don't want to burden them.\nsupporter: It's important to communicate with your partner and share your feelings, even if it feels difficult or uncomfortable.\nseeker: I suppose you're right.\nsupporter: I remember feeling the same way when I became a parent, and it really helped to talk about my struggles with my partner and seek support from others.\nseeker: It's nice to know I'm not alone in this.\nsupporter: Have you heard of any local parenting support groups? Sometimes talking with other new parents who are going through the same thing can be really helpful.\nseeker: No, I haven't. That's a great idea.\nsupporter: What are some things that bring you joy outside of parenting?\nseeker: I used to love reading and going to yoga classes.\nsupporter: When was the last time you did those things?\nseeker: It's been a few months, since the baby was born.\nsupporter: Why don't you try scheduling in some time for reading or taking a yoga class this week? It might help you feel re-energized.\nseeker: I'll try that too. Thanks for the suggestion.\nsupporter: So, it sounds like some of the challenges you're facing include feeling overwhelmed and like you don't have time for yourself or your relationship with your partner. You're finding it difficult to prioritize your own needs and are worried about not being a good parent. We talked about scheduling in some time for yourself and exploring support groups or resources for new parents. Does that sound accurate?\nseeker: Yes, that's exactly it.",

I have a lot of different interests, but I don't feel like I have a passion for any one thing in particular.\nsupporter: It must be tough not feeling like you have a clear direction. You must feel pretty uncertain about what the future holds.\nseeker: Yes, exactly. I don't know how to figure out what path to take.\nsupporter: I hear that. I remember feeling that way when I graduated from college. It's tough to be faced with so many unknowns.\nseeker: Yeah, exactly. I just don't know where to start.\nsupporter: Well, have you ever done any career exploration? Have you taken any personality tests or talked to a career counselor?\nseeker: No, I haven't. I'm not sure how to even get started with that.\nsupporter: One idea might be to start with a personality test, like the Myers-Briggs or the Enneagram. Those can give you some insight into what types of careers might be a good fit for your natural strengths and interests.\nseeker: That sounds like a good idea.\nsupporter: Great! Why don't you research those tests and take one by the end of the week? Then we can talk through the results together.\nseeker: That sounds like a good plan. Thank you!\nsupporter: In the meantime, are there any specific jobs or industries that interest you?\nseeker: Well, I've always been interested in social justice and human rights issues. I've also thought about going into education.\nsupporter: Can you give me an example of something related to social justice that you're passionate about?\nseeker: Yeah, I'm really interested in criminal justice reform.\nsupporter: Did you know that there are a lot of careers related to criminal justice reform? You might be interested in policy work for a nonprofit, public advocacy, or maybe even law school.\nseeker: I hadn't thought about those options. That's really helpful to know.\nsupporter: It sounds like you're really passionate about social justice and education, and that you're just not sure about how to connect those interests with a career.\nseeker: Exactly! It feels like there are so many options that I don't even know where to start.\nsupporter: It can be overwhelming when there are so many options, but it's a good problem to have! It means that you have a lot of potential paths that could be fulfilling.

I know this is a daunting task, but you're already taking the first steps towards figuring out your career path.\nseeker: Thank you. I really appreciate your support.\nsupporter: I remember when I was in your shoes, feeling so lost and uncertain about my career path. It took me a while to figure it out, but I eventually got there. And let me tell you, it's such a great feeling when you find work that you feel passionate about.\nseeker: That's really encouraging to hear.\nsupporter: Have you talked to anyone else about your career indecision? Your parents or a mentor, maybe?\nseeker: Not really. I'm not sure who to talk to.\nsupporter: It might be helpful to reach out to your college's alumni office and see if they have any resources for recent graduates. They might have a mentorship program or career counseling services that could be helpful.\nseeker: I hadn't thought about that.

Have you started making a list of potential job leads?\nseeker: Not yet.\nsupporter: Maybe that could be your next homework assignment!

Thank you!\nsupporter: You're on the right track! Remember, it's okay not to have everything figured out right away.

That's a really tough place to be.\nseeker: Yes, it is.\nsupporter: I just want to say that I believe in your artistic abilities and I know that you'll find your way through this.\nseeker: Thank you, that means a lot.\nsupporter: Have you tried taking a break from social media or other forms of external stimuli?\nseeker: No, I haven't really thought about that.\nsupporter: Sometimes, taking a break from social media or other external sources of information can help you tap into your own creativity and inspiration.\nseeker: That's a good idea. I'll try that.\nsupporter: It sounds like you might be feeling a bit overwhelmed by all the information and external stimuli around you, and that's making it hard to focus on your own creative process.\nseeker: Yes, I think that's part of it.\nsupporter: So, it sounds like you're dealing with a lot of external pressure and distractions that are making it hard to focus on your own creative work?\nseeker: Yes, exactly.\nsupporter: One thing that might help is to try practicing mindfulness or meditation to help clear your mind and find some inner peace.\nseeker: I've never tried that before, but it sounds interesting.\nsupporter: Why don't you try practicing mindfulness for at least 10-15 minutes a day for the next week, and see if that helps you feel more centered and focused?\nseeker: Okay, I can do that.\nsupporter: I've experienced creative blocks before, so I understand how frustrating it can be. But I also know that it's possible to break through it and find new inspiration.\nseeker: That's good to hear. It's helpful to know that I'm not alone in this.\nsupporter: Is there anything else that you want to talk about or any other areas of your life that might be contributing to your creative block?\nseeker: I don't think so. I think we covered most of it.\nsupporter: It sounds like you're dealing with burnout, a lack of external inspiration, and feeling overwhelmed by external stimuli. We talked about several strategies you can try, like taking a break, connecting with other artists, practicing mindfulness, and trying new activities to get your creative juices flowing.\nseeker: Yes, thank you for all your help and suggestions.

It's really hard to balance caregiving and taking care of myself.\nsupporter: I can see how challenging that can feel, but I want to affirm you for seeking support. That takes a lot of strength and motivation.\nseeker: Thank you, I appreciate that.\nsupporter: Have you spoken to your doctor about any resources or support programs that could help you with caregiving?\nseeker: No, I haven't thought about that.\nsupporter: Maybe it's worth looking into some options and bringing it up at your next appointment. That could be a helpful next step.\nseeker: Ok, I'll try that.\nsupporter: Can you tell me more about what's challenging about balancing caregiving and your own self-care?\nseeker: It's hard to find the time and energy to take care of myself when I'm always focused on taking care of others. And sometimes I feel guilty for taking time away from them.\nsupporter: It sounds like you're feeling overwhelmed and torn between taking care of yourself and your caregiving responsibilities. And guilt is also coming up for you.\nseeker: Yes, exactly.\nsupporter: So it sounds like you're feeling burnt out and struggling to find a balance between caring for others and yourself.\nseeker: Yes, that's a good way to put it.\nsupporter: Have you ever tried visualizing a scenario where you're able to balance both caregiving and self-care without sacrificing one for the other?\nseeker: No, I haven't.\nsupporter: It could be helpful to try that. Let's take a moment to visualize what that might look like for you. Close your eyes and imagine yourself taking care of your loved ones while also making time for your own needs and self-care.\nseeker: That feels nice, but it's hard to make it a reality.\nsupporter: One thing you could try is setting aside specific time for yourself each day, whether it's for a relaxing activity, going for a walk, or just taking a break to recharge. And communicating with your loved ones about your needs and asking for their support.\nseeker: That's a good idea.\nsupporter: It's also important to remember that taking care of yourself is actually a crucial part of being a good caregiver. By prioritizing your own health and well-being, you'll have more energy and resources to give to your loved ones.\nseeker: That makes sense.\nsupporter: Are there any specific ways that I can support you through this process?\nseeker: Just listening and understanding is a huge help.\nsupporter: I hear that you're feeling overwhelmed and unsupported, and it's important to have someone who can really listen and empathize with you without judgement.\nseeker: Yes, exactly.\nsupporter: Can you tell me more about a specific instance where you felt like you were sacrificing your own needs for your caregiving responsibilities?\nseeker: Well, last week I missed a crucial appointment for my own medical care because I was so focused on taking care of my loved one. I felt sick for days afterwards.\nsupporter: Hearing that makes me feel really sad for you. It's tough to feel like you're putting your own well-being on the back burner.\nseeker: Yes, it definitely is.\nsupporter: It might be worth exploring ways to delegate some of your caregiving responsibilities to others, so that you can prioritize your own health and well-being.\nseeker: That's a good point.\nsupporter: Have you talked to your loved ones about how you're feeling and asked for their help or support?\nseeker: Not really, no.\nsupporter: Having an open and honest conversation with them about your needs and how they can support you might be a helpful next step.\nseeker: Ok, that's something to consider.\nsupporter: So it sounds like the challenges you're facing involve balancing caregiving and self-care, feeling guilty for prioritizing your own needs, and possibly delegating some responsibilities and communication with loved ones.\nseeker: Yes, that's a good summary.\nsupporter: Here's a homework assignment for you\nseeker: Ok, I will do that.

Can you start by telling me a little bit about what's been going on for you lately?\nseeker: I'm a student and I'm dealing with a lot of stress and pressure related to schoolwork, peer relationships, and my future plans. It's been really overwhelming and I'm not sure how to cope.\nsupporter: It sounds like you're really overwhelmed with a lot of different things all at once. Is that right?\nseeker: Yes, exactly. I feel like I'm drowning in everything that's going on.\nsupporter: That's completely understandable. It sounds like you're going through a really tough time.\nseeker: Yeah, I just feel like I'm never going to be able to get everything done that I need to.\nsupporter: It's important to be organized and have a plan when you're dealing with a lot of different tasks. Have you considered creating a to-do list or schedule to help you manage your time better?\nseeker: I have, but sometimes it just feels like there's not enough time in the day.\nsupporter: That's a really common feeling, but it's important to remember that you can only do so much. If you imagine yourself as a plate, you can only fit so much on it before things start to spill over. It's important to prioritize the most important tasks and give yourself permission to let go of things that aren't as crucial.\nseeker: That's a really good visualization. I'll try to keep that in mind.\nsupporter: Great! As a homework assignment, why don't you try creating a schedule for yourself that includes all of your tasks and gives yourself some breaks throughout the day. Try it out for a week and see if it makes a difference in managing your stress levels.\nseeker: That's a good idea.

That takes a lot of courage.\nseeker: Yeah, I know I need to do something to manage all of this stress.\nsupporter: It's important to remember that you're not alone in this. Many students deal with these same stressors and pressures. You're doing the best you can, and that's all anyone can ask.\nseeker: Thank you, that means a lot to hear.\nsupporter: So it sounds like you're feeling really overwhelmed with all of the demands on your plate, and you're not sure how to manage it all. We talked about creating a schedule or to-do list to prioritize your tasks and taking breaks throughout the day, and giving yourself permission to let go of non-essential tasks to manage stress levels. Does that sound right?\nseeker: Yes, that sounds great.\nsupporter: I also want to point out that it's common for students to put a lot of pressure on themselves to be perfect and to excel in every area. But it's important to remember that it's okay to make mistakes and to prioritize your own well-being too. Failure is just another opportunity to learn and grow.\nseeker: Thank you for saying that. I needed to hear it.\nsupporter: I remember feeling the same way when I was a student, and it can be really tough. But looking back, I wish I had given myself more grace and compassion during that time.\nseeker: It's nice to hear from someone who understands what I'm going through.\nsupporter: Can you tell me more about the peer relationships you mentioned earlier? Is there a specific issue you're dealing with?\nseeker: Yeah, I feel like I'm having a hard time making friends in my classes. I'm pretty shy, so it's hard for me to approach new people.\nsupporter: That sounds really difficult. Can you think of a specific instance where you had a hard time meeting new people?\nseeker: Well, there was a class project we had to do recently and I felt like nobody wanted to work with me.\nsupporter: That can be tough.

It's exhausting.\nsupporter: It sounds like you're feeling really weighed down by the expectations of society.\nseeker: Yes, exactly. It's like I can't measure up no matter how hard I try.\nsupporter: What specific expectations are the most difficult for you to deal with?\nseeker: Honestly, it's the pressure to always be happy and successful.

It takes a lot of strength and courage to confront those expectations.\nseeker: Thank you, it's good to hear that I'm not alone in feeling this way.\nsupporter: Can you give me an example of a time when you felt like you were failing to meet these expectations?\nseeker: Well, I recently got passed over for a promotion at work and it made me feel like I'm not successful enough.\nsupporter: It sounds like not getting the promotion was really tough for you and made you question your worth as an employee.\nseeker: Yes, exactly.\nsupporter: Have you considered talking to your boss or colleagues about what you can do to improve your chances of getting a promotion in the future?\nseeker: No, I haven't really thought about that. I just assumed that I'm not good enough for the job.\nsupporter: It's important to remember that just because you didn't get the promotion this time, doesn't mean you're not good enough. It could be that there was a particular skill or experience that the other candidate had that you didn't.\nseeker: That's a good point. Maybe I should talk to my boss and see if there's anything I can do to improve my chances next time.\nsupporter: That's a great idea.

Just because you don't look like a certain model or actor doesn't mean you're not attractive.\nseeker: I know, but it's hard to believe that sometimes.\nsupporter: I want you to take a few minutes each day to write down some things that you like about your appearance. They don't have to be major things, just small details that you appreciate.\nseeker: Okay, I can do that.\nsupporter: That's a really positive step towards improving your self-esteem. I'm proud of you.\nseeker: Thank you.\nsupporter: Take a moment to imagine what it would be like to truly love and accept your body and appearance.

It's okay to take things one step at a time and to recognize that you can't change the past, but you can work on moving forward.\nseeker: Yeah, that's a good point. I'll try to remember that.\nsupporter: By the way, how have you been taking care of yourself lately? Have you been getting enough rest and eating well?\nseeker: To be honest, not really.
